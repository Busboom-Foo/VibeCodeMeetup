# Fartogger

A humorous take on the classic Frogger game, where the frog moves by farting. This game is built with TypeScript and HTML5 Canvas.

## Game Features

- Control the frog with arrow keys (left/right) and space bar to fart (move forward)
- Multiple fart types with different effects: short farts, long farts, circle farts, and more
- Power-ups that give special fart abilities
- Cars that can be slowed down by farts
- Multiple levels with increasing difficulty
- High score system

## How to Play

1. Use the left and right arrow keys to move the frog left and right
2. Press space to fart, which propels the frog upward
3. Avoid cars while trying to cross to the top of the screen
4. Collect power-ups to gain special fart abilities
5. Complete levels by reaching the top of the screen
6. Try to achieve a high score!

## Development Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start

# Build for production

```

Alternatively, you can use the convenience script:

```bash
# Build and run the game

```
